# Submitting prepared libraries for sequencing

Two types of libraries are generated following the [ASAP-seq](https://cite-seq.com/asapseq/) experimental pipeline:
1. One for the peaks, with the library structure [here](https://teichlab.github.io/scg_lib_structs/methods_html/10xChromium_scATAC.html)
2. Another for the antibody capture and hashtag information which you can find the library strcuture of [here](https://github.com/romagnanilab/single_cell_analysis/blob/3c8e77babbde4d7305c3c9f8d893ef4104df45ed/static_files/asap_assay_scheme.pdf)
